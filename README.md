**Building a Spring Boot microservice from scratch.**

This is the task I performed as a part of training provided by Nortal on building a Spring Boot microservice from scratch.

In this course about Spring Boot microservices, I have learned about the basics of creating a Java Spring Boot backend API from the ground up. It included from the very basics of installing the environment to initializing the API, using Spring Data JPA and H2 in-memory databases, up to building a jar file that can be deployed in the future. More about this is here: https://nortal.com/guided-learning/spring/.

So it is not my genuine code, actually. It was just entered by me based on the training materials that were provided.

Maybe I will return to this project someday and add my own code to it.
