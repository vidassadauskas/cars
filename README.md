Building a Spring Boot microservice from scratch.

This is the task I performed as a part of training provided by Nortal on building a Spring Boot microservice from scratch.

In this course about Spring Boot microservices, I have learned about the basics of creating a Java Spring Boot backend API from the ground up. It included from the very basics of installing the environment to initializing the API, using Spring Data JPA and H2 in-memory databases, up to building a jar file that can be deployed in the future.
